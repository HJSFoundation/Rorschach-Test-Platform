In psychology, testing is largely used in order to assess mental constructs, such as cognitive and emotional functioning, of individuals.
Tests permit researchers to easily reach a large population of subjects.
Tests introduce also quantitative aspects to the psychological introspection mechanisms.\\
\\
To design tests and run them an open source platform is commonly available.
This platform, called OpenSesame, provides researchers with an advanced and easy to use experiment builder to support their researches.\\
\\
This article presents a platform designed to provide additional social information to the tests implemented on the OpenSesame platform.
The platform presented is able to compute sociological indexes on the Facebook networks of the subjects using SNA techniques.
These indexes are meant to integrate the data coming from test execution and enrich it with social information about the subjects.\\
