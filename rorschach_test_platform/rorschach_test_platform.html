<h1>Rorschach Test Platform integration plugin</h1>
<p>This plagin integrates with the Rorschach Test Platform application on Facebook. This application, is available
at the following link: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/rorschach_test_platf/">http://apps.facebook.com/rorschach_test_platf/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Description of the application:</b></p>
<p>This is an application which aims to dispense psychological tests easily using Facebook. On this application administrators can define tests to be submitted to the Facebook users to complete.</p> 
<p>Thanks to the features and information offered by Facebook the application is able to integrate the testing data with other relevant information about the users. In particular the application leverages the techniques of Social Network Analysis (SNA, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis" target="_blank">read more on Wikipedia</a>) to compute sociological indexes on the users.</p>
<p>These indexes are:
<ul>
    <li>Basic indexes on the network configuration</li>
    <li>Centrality indexes</li>
    <li>Group indexes on subgraphs and cliques</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>This approach permits to obtain richer information on social psychology and other fields in test based psychological research and analysis.</p>

<p><b>The plugin:</b></p>
<p>This plugin permits to download social indexes computed with SNA techniques from the users accessing the test. The users needs to use the Rorschach Test Platform to compute the indexes which are then downloaded and added to the test data.</p>
<p>The test administrator has to associate the test he/she is configuring inside OpenSesame with a test defined in the Rorschach Test Platform and then can specify the indexes that must be computed in the test data.</p>
